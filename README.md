## TypeScript Compiler for Meteor

TypeScript files are compiled into ES5 and CommonJS modules by default.

> Based on TypeScript@2.0.10

Default compiler options as JSON:
````json
{
  "module": "commonjs",
  "target": "es5",
  "moduleResolution": "node",
  "experimentalDecorators": true,
  "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
  "sourceMap": true
}
````
## ES6

Since Meteor 1.4, which is based on Node.js v4.0, it's possible to use ES6 on the server.

If you want to compile into ES6 on the server, put a `tsconfig.json` into the server folder:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6"
  }
}
```

## Typings

There are several sources of typings you'll need to know about when developing a Meteor app with TypeScript:
* Typings from NPM packages:
   * More and more NPM packages come today with typings along with the source code files themselves.
      TypeScript reads and applies them automatically, so users are free of burden supporting them
      at all in this case. Angular 2 NPMs are a good example of them.
   * Special NPM packages that contain only typings.
      Since 2.0.0 TypeScript supports referencing NPM packages directly in ts-files as was possible only with individual files before.
      For example, `/// <reference types="@types/jquery" />` reference will apply jQuery typings from `@types/jquery` NPM package if it
      exists. `@types` is a special NPM scope supported by the TypeScript authors which now
      contains copies of typings from [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)
      repo. It's possible though to install any NPM package with typings like that.
* Typings installed and managed by [`typings`](https://github.com/typings/typings) utility.
   It's de-facto a major tool to manage typings today. Besides features to
   search and install typings from DefinitelyTyped, it has own typings repository supported by the community.
   So makes sense to give it at a try, if you haven't found typings in DefinitelyTyped.
   It can also install typings even from GitHub repos and locally folders.
* Typings related to Meteor itself (usually it means various Atmosphere packages).
   You can find most typings available for Meteor [here](https://github.com/meteor-typings).
   Some of them are already published as NPM packages, which means they can be installed 
   as described above. If not, you can always install them with help of `typings` utility.
   For more info, please read [here](https://github.com/meteor-typings/meteor).
* Custom typings.

### Installation

To install Meteor declaration files, you'll need to run in the terminal as follows:
````
npm install typings -g

typings install env~meteor --global
````

Or install `meteor-typings` NPM and add
```ts
/// <reference types="meteor-typings" />
```
at the top of the main ts-file (that runs first).

For more information, please read README at https://github.com/meteor-typings/meteor.

### Typings Processing

Typings files are processed in the same way as regular ts-files. 
Particularly, it means that placing a declaration file in the server folder,
for example, will apply it to the server ts-files only.

Besides that, this package recognizes two subfolder of the `typings` folder:
`typigns/main` and `typings/browser`. Files from the former will be used for the server
code, and from the latter -- for the browser code accordingly.
This is especially useful if you use `typings` utility to manage typings,
which supports typings separation for the client and server code
(but only for packages from the own repo).

> Please note that any change to global typings will cause re-compilation of the whole project,
> including the case when types references (see above) added or removed from ts-files.

If you change some custom declaration file often, it makes sence to reference it locally in ts-files where used
but exlude it globally, i.e., in the config:
```ts
 /// <reference path="typings/foo.d.ts" />
```
```json
{
  "exclude": ["typings/foo.d.ts"]
}
```

## Example

As an example, check out a simple TODO app built with Angular2 and TypeScript,

## Package Structure

This package uses (directly or indirectly) three other packages, which are worth to mention:

[typescript-compiler](https://github.com/barbatus/typescript-compiler) - exports a Meteor TypeScript compiler that implements Meteor compiler API. TypeScript compiler in its turn uses [meteor-typescript](https://github.com/barbatus/meteor-typescript) packageâ€™s API
to compile TypeScript source code incrementally on file changes.

[meteor-typescript](https://github.com/barbatus/meteor-typescript) - an NPM package that exports an incremental TypeScript build class.
That class is designed to be used in the series of subsequent compilations of TypeScript source code. In that case, TypeScript Service API, which is used internally, allows to reuse compilation statistics and data between subsequent builds, thus, improving speed of the compilation.

[typescript-runtime](https://github.com/barbatus/typescript-runtime) - currently contains TypeScript helpers,
which allow to configure behavior of some parts of the compiled TypeScript code for special use cases. One of the use cases is usage with the old browsers.
