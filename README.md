## TypeScript Compiler for Meteor

### Env Vars

- `TYPESCRIPT_EXTERNAL_PATH` can be set to the path of a typescript node package anywhere on your computer to be able to use a different version that is used in the package by default
- `TYPESCRIPT_DISABLE_WARNINGS` can be used to only show lifecycle information and errors

### Default Compiler Information

TypeScript files are compiled into ES5 and CommonJS modules by default.

Default compiler options as JSON:

```json
{
  "module": "commonjs",
  "target": "es5",
  "moduleResolution": "node",
  "experimentalDecorators": true,
  "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
  "sourceMap": true
}
```

## Package Structure

This package uses (directly or indirectly) three other packages, which are worth to mention:

[typescript-compiler](https://github.com/adornis/typescript-compiler) - exports a Meteor TypeScript compiler that implements Meteor compiler API. TypeScript compiler in its turn uses [meteor-typescript](https://github.com/adornis/meteor-typescript) packageâ€™s API
to compile TypeScript source code incrementally on file changes.

[typescript-runtime](https://github.com/adornis/typescript-runtime) - currently contains TypeScript helpers,
which allow to configure behavior of some parts of the compiled TypeScript code for special use cases. One of the use cases is usage with the old browsers.
