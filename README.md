## TypeScript Compiler for Meteor

TypeScript files are compiled into ES5 and CommonJS modules by default.

Default compiler options as JSON:

```json
{
  "module": "commonjs",
  "target": "es5",
  "moduleResolution": "node",
  "experimentalDecorators": true,
  "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
  "sourceMap": true
}
```

## Path mappings

TypeScript paths mapping is supported since `0.6.0`, though,
with some limitations. It works only for local files and for `module: commonjs`.

You can now use paths like `imports/client/foo` instead of Meteor rooted
paths like `/imports/client/foo` if you add to the `config.json` as follows:

```json
  "baseUrl": ".",
  "paths": {
    "*": ["*"]
  }
```

## Package Structure

This package uses (directly or indirectly) three other packages, which are worth to mention:

[typescript-compiler](https://github.com/barbatus/typescript-compiler) - exports a Meteor TypeScript compiler that implements Meteor compiler API. TypeScript compiler in its turn uses [meteor-typescript](https://github.com/barbatus/meteor-typescript) packageâ€™s API
to compile TypeScript source code incrementally on file changes.

[typescript-runtime](https://github.com/barbatus/typescript-runtime) - currently contains TypeScript helpers,
which allow to configure behavior of some parts of the compiled TypeScript code for special use cases. One of the use cases is usage with the old browsers.
